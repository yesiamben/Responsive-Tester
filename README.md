# Responsive-Tester

Recently, I was chatting to a client about responsive design and testing. I mentioned something I'd been using locally for a while and figured they'd find it useful. So here's a little something I use when I'm building websites and landing pages. I hope you find it useful.

You can see an online working version at [http://www.responsivetester.net](http://www.responsivetester.net) - you'll also find some more instructions there.

It's all MIT licensed, so feel free to use as you please. That said, if you find it useful, I'd appreciate a link and I'd love to see what you've made :-)
